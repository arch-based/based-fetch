# based-fetch - Suckless Fetching Utility

`based-fetch` is a BASED, Suckless Fetching Utility written in the One and Only Programming Language that is still the best.

## Features

- **Universal Compatibility**: `based-fetch` can be built on any Linux distribution, making it highly versatile and accessible to a wide range of users.
- **Customizable Output**: Users can tailor the output to their preferences, enhancing the user experience and allowing for greater flexibility.
- **Source Code Distribution**: `based-fetch` is distributed as source code rather than a pre-built binary, promoting transparency and flexibility.
- **Memory Safety**: `based-fetch` uses the `free()` function to deallocate memory once it's no longer needed, helping prevent memory leaks and contributing to the overall safety of the utility.

## Building from Source

As per the "suckless" philosophy, `based-fetch` is designed to be built from source. Here's how you can do it with the use of the Makefile:

```
# make clean install
```

## Usage

Using the $PATH environment variable you can run it indirectly without typing in the whole path. However, you may be familiar with this binary name in my other repository, sfetch, I wanted to use it so I can use this based-fetch utility as sfetch is the shortest name in my arsenal:

```
$ sfetch
```
